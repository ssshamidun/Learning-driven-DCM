# Learning-driven-DCM
Learning-Driven DCM for biped locomotion: physics-guided DCM/ICP preview + PPO. A teacher pipeline (DCM predictor → Δξ offset → CoM update → IK) supplies stable references; differentiable stability costs improve convergence and robustness. Includes an Isaac Gym point-foot task and flat/stair benchmarks.
